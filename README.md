## Electronic Cane for Visually Impaired Individuals

Welcome to the Electronic Cane repository!

### Overview:
The Electronic Cane is an innovative solution developed and implemented using C coding and Arduino technology. It aims to assist visually impaired individuals by providing real-time auditory alerts based on obstacle proximity.

### Features:
- **Electronic Cane Design**: The project involves the design and implementation of an electronic cane equipped with ultrasonic sensors.
- **Real-time Auditory Alerts**: Programmed in C, the cane offers real-time auditory alerts to users based on obstacle proximity detected by the ultrasonic sensors.
- **French Bac Exam Recognition**: The project achieved a score of 100% during the French Baccalaur√©at exam, highlighting its successful completion and effectiveness.
- **Arduino Platform**: C coding was utilized within the Arduino platform to create a robust program. This program triggers specific frequencies corresponding to varying distances, providing users with accurate feedback on obstacle proximity.

### How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed.
- Connect your Arduino board and ultrasonic sensors according to the provided schematics.
- Upload the C program to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
- Test the electronic cane in various environments to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting obstacles and providing auditory alerts.
